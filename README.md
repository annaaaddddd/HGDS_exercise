This Unity project has the following features:
- Start button (disables gravity until pressed).
- Jumping mechanic with airborne collectibles.
- Power-up capsule that changes player color, increases speed, and shows on-screen text.
- A special wall that can only be broken after collecting the power-up.
- A goal zone across a gap; reaching it shows a "You win!" message.
